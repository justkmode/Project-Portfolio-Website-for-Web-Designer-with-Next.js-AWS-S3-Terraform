**Project Overview: Portfolio Website Deployment**

**Client:** James Smith, a freelance web designer

**Project Description:**  
James Smith, a freelance web designer, needs a modern, responsive single-page website to showcase his work and attract potential clients. The website is built using Next.js, and the goal is to host it on a robust, scalable, and cost-effective platform. The site needs to be highly available, scalable, cost-effective, and optimized for fast loading times globally.

**Project Outcome:**  
By the end of this project, the following objectives were achieved:

1. **Deployed a Next.js Website:** Successfully deployed the Next.js portfolio site on AWS.
2. **Implemented Infrastructure as Code:** Used Terraform to automate the creation of AWS resources.
3. **Configured Global Content Delivery:** Set up AWS CloudFront to deliver website content globally with low latency.
4. **Ensured Security and Performance:** Applied best practices for security and performance to ensure a fast and secure website.

**Steps Taken:**

1. **Prepare the Next.js Application:**
   - **Create a GitHub Repository:**
     - Created a new GitHub repository named `terraform-portfolio-project`.
     - Initialized the repository with a README file.
   - **Clone the Repository:**
     - Cloned the repository with: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/terraform-portfolio-project.git`
     - Navigated to the project directory: `cd terraform-portfolio-project`

2. **Clone the Next.js Portfolio Starter Kit:**
   - Cloned the portfolio starter kit using:  
     ```bash
     npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/basics/learn-starter"
     ```
   - Navigated to the project directory: `cd nextjs-blog`
   - Started the development server: `npm run dev` (accessible at http://localhost:3000/)

3. **Configure Next.js for Static Export:**
   - Created a `next.config.js` file in the root of the folder with the following content:
     ```javascript
     /**
      * @type {import('next').NextConfig}
      */
     const nextConfig = {
       output: 'export',
     }
     module.exports = nextConfig
     ```
   - Ran the build command: `npm run build`, which generated an `out` folder.

4. **Initialize Git and Push to GitHub:**
   - Initialized Git in the project folder:
     ```bash
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit of Next.js portfolio starter kit"
     git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/terraform-portfolio-project.git
     git push -u origin master
     ```
