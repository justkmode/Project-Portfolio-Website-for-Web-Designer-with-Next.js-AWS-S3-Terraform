### **Scenario Overview**

#### **Client Description**:
James Smith is a freelance web designer looking to expand his client base by showcasing his portfolio online. He has built a modern, responsive single-page website using **Next.js**, which highlights his design work. James wants this website hosted in a way that ensures both high performance and reliability.

#### **Project Description**:
James requires his portfolio website to be:
- **Highly Available**: Accessible to users worldwide with minimal downtime.
- **Scalable**: Able to handle traffic increases as his portfolio gains popularity.
- **Cost-Effective**: Keep hosting costs low while maintaining performance.
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized loading times for a seamless user experience.

As the cloud engineer, my task was to deploy James's Next.js portfolio website on **AWS** using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** via **Terraform**. The architecture was designed to meet the above requirements by leveraging AWS services such as **S3** and **CloudFront**.

### **Problem Statement**
James's main requirements for the website are:
1. **Highly Available**: Ensure global uptime with minimal downtime.
2. **Scalable**: Handle increased traffic without performance degradation.
3. **Cost-Effective**: Provide a solution with optimized costs.
4. **Fast Loading**: Deliver fast loading times to a global audience.

### **Solution**:
Deploying the Next.js website using **AWS S3** for static hosting and **CloudFront** for global content delivery addressed these requirements. The use of **Terraform** ensured the infrastructure was managed efficiently, enabling repeatability and ease of future updates.

### **Project Outcome**
The project resulted in a successful deployment of James's portfolio website, meeting all of his requirements.

#### **1. Deployed a Next.js Website**:
The **Next.js** portfolio website was deployed on AWS using **S3** to host the static content. S3 is an ideal service for static websites due to its high availability, scalability, and low cost.

#### **2. Implemented Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform**:
The entire infrastructure was provisioned using **Terraform**, enabling:
- **Automated creation of AWS resources** such as S3 buckets, CloudFront distribution, and IAM policies.
- **Version control of infrastructure**: Terraform files were stored in a GitHub repository, allowing future updates and modifications to be easily tracked and managed.

#### **3. Configured Global Content Delivery with CloudFront**:
To ensure fast loading times across the globe, **AWS CloudFront** was implemented as a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**. CloudFront improves performance by caching content at edge locations worldwide, reducing latency for global users.

#### **4. Ensured Security and Performance**:
- **SSL/TLS Certificates**: To provide a secure connection (HTTPS), **AWS Certificate Manager** (ACM) was used to provision and manage SSL certificates, enhancing both security and performance.
- **Access Restrictions**: Security best practices were followed by restricting access to the S3 bucket and ensuring that only CloudFront could access the content.
- **Performance Optimization**: CloudFront's caching and S3's high-speed access ensured that the website was optimized for performance, allowing for fast load times.

#### **5. Deployed Project to GitHub**:
All project files, including the Terraform configurations, were uploaded to a **GitHub repository**. This allows for easy collaboration, versioning, and future updates.

### **Architecture Design**
Here is the architecture of the solution:

1. **AWS S3**: 
   - The static website content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is hosted on **S3**, which is highly available and scalable.
   - S3 was configured for static website hosting.

2. **AWS CloudFront**:
   - CloudFront is used as a CDN to deliver content globally with low latency.
   - The **CloudFront distribution** is configured to cache content at multiple edge locations worldwide, ensuring that users get fast load times no matter where they are located.

3. **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**:
   - An SSL certificate was provisioned to ensure secure communication between users and CloudFront over HTTPS.

4. **Terraform**:
   - All AWS resources were defined using **Terraform**, following Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. This makes the deployment reproducible and scalable for future updates.

5. **IAM Roles and Policies**:
   - **IAM roles and policies** were created to control access to the S3 bucket and allow CloudFront to serve the content.

---

### **Steps for Future Development**:
- **Monitor and Optimize Costs**: Regularly monitor AWS billing and optimize resources as traffic grows to ensure cost-effectiveness.
- **Scalability Adjustments**: As the portfolio website gains more traffic, auto-scaling mechanisms can be explored to handle additional load.

This project demonstrates how cloud technologies (AWS, Terraform) can be leveraged to deploy a highly available, secure, and performant website for clients. Through automation with Terraform, the infrastructure can be easily scaled and modified as Jamesâ€™s portfolio grows.
