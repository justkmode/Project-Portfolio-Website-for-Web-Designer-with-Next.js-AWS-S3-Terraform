Client Project Brief
Scenario Overview
Client: James Smith, a freelance web designer

Project: Portfolio Website Deployment

Project Description:  James Smith, a freelance web designer, wants to showcase his work and attract potential clients through an online portfolio. He has designed a modern, responsive single-page website using the Next.js framework. James requires this website to be hosted on a robust, scalable, and cost-effective platform. Additionally, the website needs to be highly available and deliver fast loading times for a global audience.

Your Role: As a team of cloud engineers, your task is to deploy James's Next.js portfolio website on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles with Terraform. This project is a hands-on experience with Terraform, S3, and CloudFront, mimicking a real-world deployment scenario.

Problem Statement
James needs his portfolio website to be:

Highly Available: The website should be accessible to users worldwide with minimal downtime.
Scalable: As his portfolio gains traction, the hosting solution should handle increased traffic without performance degradation.
Cost-Effective: Hosting costs should be optimized, avoiding unnecessary expenses.
Fast Loading: The website should load quickly for visitors, providing a seamless user experience.
Given these requirements, deploying the website using AWS services such as S3 for static hosting and CloudFront for content delivery is an ideal solution. Using Terraform will allow you to automate and manage the infrastructure efficiently.

Project Outcome
By the end of this project, you should have:

Deployed a Next.js Website: Successfully deployed the Next.js portfolio site on AWS.

Implemented Infrastructure as Code: Used Terraform to automate the creation of AWS resources.

Configured Global Content Delivery: Set up AWS CloudFront to deliver the website content globally with low latency.

Ensured Security and Performance: Applied best practices for security and performance, ensuring a fast and secure website for James's portfolio.

Deploy everything to github: Create a github repo and host all your project files and code there.
